# Changelog

## Changed in v32

* Show my tooltips for races on the Blizzard race POIs when enabled (in the Blizzard filters menu)
* Dornogal: Tome of Polymorph: Mosswool
* Fix non-npc non-treasure points without completion from being considered "found" always
* Mostly for myself, but just in case... you can now alt-click the map button to quickly toggle showing found points

## Changed in v31

* Change how the "show npcs" setting works: it now has a submenu that lets you choose a filter, where you can choose to see *all* npcs, only npcs that you can currently get loot from (the default), or only npcs that you can get "notable" loot from
* New setting to control whether unlearned transmog appearances count as notable
* New setting to add some emphasis to the icons for NPCs that are notable
* Fix the "show treasure" setting so that it *only* affects treasures -- it was also controlling other non-npc points
